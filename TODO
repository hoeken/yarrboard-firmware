Firmware:
    * tie led state to switch state
        * Switch dropdown on LED config (what LED to follow)
        * set on, off, trip colors
    * update forms to be consistent style (float labels)
    * go through and re-adjust the various page sizes for our different viewports
    * protocol documentation
    * wifi improvements:
        * wifi connection fail should default to AP mode
        * wifi should reconnect on failure

8ch MOSFET:
    * move to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal
    * switch to ESP32-S3-DEV-KIT-N8R8 module board (waveshare w/ castellated pins)
    * better ADC for current sense: MCP3564R
    * switch to "pcb welding terminal" connection: T44001
    * switch to M4 on busbar
    * completely bypass current sensing with fuse + 4 layer board (use bottom layer)
    * extend the busbar a little bit so the MEGA fuse and on-terminal fuses fit too.

RGB Input:
    * switch to esp32-s3 module board (waveshare w/ castellated pins)
    * move to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal
    * remove the MISO line from rgb chip completely, doesnt work.
    * drop the ADC - make a separate board
    * pin header to connect to rgb button board
    * rename channels, should start with 1

Electronics:
    * update 3dp case for 8ch mosfet

Long Term Ideas:
    * ADC board
        * best ADC chip available
        * figure out how to support the widest variety of inputs
    * Relay board - DC or AC?
    * Motor driver / H bridge?
    * attempt to migrate to esp32 arduino 3.0: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/migration_guides/2.x_to_3.0.html
    * manual OTA upload
    * learn about building components for node-red, maybe make a yarrboard toolkit
