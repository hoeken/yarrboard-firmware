# FROTHFET REV D

* convert ADC to continuous interrupt driven style
* rgb status should have its own .h/.cpp file
    * we should do something interesting with it.
    * wifi connection status?
* add temperature, vdd support to adc library
* upgrade to esp-idf 5.1.x and fix any issues
* upgrade to PsychicHttp 2.0
* clean up #includes and libraries
* add wifi RSSI bars indicator
* update forms to be consistent style (float labels)
* switch to 1 indexed channels instead of zero
* update yarrboard client if any changes needed - probably for state
* update signalk plugin - same
* go through and re-adjust the various page sizes for our different viewports
* protocol documentation
* wifi improvements:
    * wifi connection fail should default to AP mode
    * wifi should reconnect on failure

# BRINEOMATIC

* add indicator for diverter valve, motor, fan, flush valve
* set flowrate to zero once we start our run
* minus flowrate from totalFlowrate too
* add fan control based on temperature
* add mid-level commands to set_watermaker
    * boost_pump
    * high_pressure_pump
    * flush_valve
    * fan
    * membrane_pressure_target
* add mid level UI icons/commands for watermaker parts:
    * boost_pump
    * hp pump
    * diverter valve
    * flush valve
    * fan
* move everything to SI units, add configurable units
* add configuration options for:
    * flowmeter
    * tds (can we autodetect - whats this look like?)
    * diverter valve
    * hp valve servo
    * hp valve relay
    * diverter valve relay
    * default intervals for flush, etc.
    * options for display units
    * timeouts
    * high/low values
* add tds calibration
* ntp server and next flush being an actual time that is stored in preferences (survive reboot)

# LONG TERM:

* Look into turning yarrboard UI/framework into a library for use in other projects (brineomatic)
* Integrations with other automation frameworks?
    * Home Assistant
    * mqqt?
* other MFD integrations:
    * garmin?
    * raymarine?
