# FROTHFET REV D

* convert ADC to continuous interrupt driven style
* rgb status should have its own .h/.cpp file
    * we should do something interesting with it.
    * wifi connection status?
* add temperature, vdd support to adc library
* upgrade to esp-idf 5.1.x and fix any issues
* upgrade to PsychicHttp 2.0
* clean up #includes and libraries
* add wifi RSSI bars indicator
* update forms to be consistent style (float labels)
* switch to 1 indexed channels instead of zero
* update yarrboard client if any changes needed - probably for state
* update signalk plugin - same
* go through and re-adjust the various page sizes for our different viewports
* protocol documentation
* wifi improvements:
    * wifi connection fail should default to AP mode
    * wifi should reconnect on failure

# BRINEOMATIC

* add flowmeter volume accumulator
* add fan control based on temperature
* move everything to SI units
* add configuration options for:
    * flowmeter
    * tds (can we autodetect - whats this look like?)
    * diverter valve
    * hp valve servo
    * hp valve relay
    * diverter valve relay
    * default intervals for flush, etc.
    * options for display units
* add tds calibration
* add water_temperature
* add timeouts to while() loops in state machine
* add safety checks for salinity and flowrate in RUNNING main loop.
* figure out why sendDebug() is crashing in state machine task.
* update UI to only show relevant data during the right mode
* add a DEPICKLING mode that uses seawater instead of fresh to depickle.
* add a total runtime counter.
* add a STOPPING mode for when the watermaker is shutting down but not yet flushing
    * need to pass in a next state? no should always be flush.  only coming from running.
* add a way to bubble up errors from state machine.

# LONG TERM:

* Look into turning yarrboard UI/framework into a library for use in other projects (brineomatic)
* Integrations with other automation frameworks?
    * Home Assistant
    * mqqt?
* other MFD integrations:
    * garmin?
    * raymarine?
