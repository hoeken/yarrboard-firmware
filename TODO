Firmware:
    * fixing the race conditions
        * add "source" to input and pwm
            * source is a required parameter for set_pwm and set_input now
            * need to set source when updating internally too, use local_hostname
        * add source to update json
        * change input and pwm state output to be enum style: "ON", "OFF", "TRIPPED" or "ON", "OFF"
        * change web UI to handle new state stuff

    * tie led state to switch state
        * switch dropdown on LED config (what switch to use)
        * set on + off colors
            * hardcode to off / green to start

    * add output type to mosfets
        * light, motor, pump, fan, solenoid, electronics, other
        * add icons for each type to display on UI
    * need to have a darkmode logo
    * protocol documentation
    * wifi connection fail should default to AP mode

8ch MOSFET:
    * switch to esp32-s3 module board (waveshare w/ castellated pins)
    * remove CAN port - never going to use it.
    * change fan2 tach to pin 4
    * combine fan 1 pwm and fan 2 pwm to pin 16
    * add voltage detector to each channel for run detection - another mcp3208 + bus voltage divider circuit
    * maybe switch to "pcb welding terminal" connection like 74650073R or C5370858 or C3029538
        * or at least a 9.5mm pitch barrier terminal like C496131 or C430699 or C430687 or C707586
    * move to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal
    * bypass current sensing too with fuse + 4 layer board (use bottom layer)
    * extend the busbar a little bit so the MEGA fuse fits
    * pwm channel 5 is used for boot / uploading

RGB Input:
    * switch to esp32-s3 module board (waveshare w/ castellated pins)
    * move to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal
    * remove the MISO line completely, doesnt work.
    * drop the ADC - make a separate board
    * pin header to connect to rgb button board

RGB Button Board:
    * number buttons/leds like pins on a chip
    * flip the connector pins
    * pin header to connect to rgb input board
    * same size / hole spacing as rgb input board
    * center the button pads
    * possibly extra 0.5 or 1mm spacing between the 2x2 modules
    * remove entire ring of soldermask

Electronics:
    * update 3dp case for 8ch mosfet

Long Term Maybe?
    * Relay board - DC or AC?
    * Motor driver / H bridge?
    * attempt to migrate to esp32 arduino 3.0: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/migration_guides/2.x_to_3.0.html
    * manual OTA upload
    * learn about building components for node-red, maybe make a yarrboard toolkit
