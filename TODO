Firmware:
    * FROTHFET REV D
        * add new state BYPASSED when:
            * channel is OFF, but voltage is within 10% of bus voltage
        * add new state BLOWN when:
            * channel is ON, but voltage is < 1V
        * 
        * figure out how to handle voltage and wattage during PWM.
            * maybe use bus voltage?
    * fix the issues with the upgrade to ArduinoJSON 7
    * upgrade to esp-idf 5.1.x and fix any issues
    * upgrade to PsychicHttp 2.0

    * tie led state to switch state
        * Switch dropdown on LED config (what LED to follow)
        * set on, off, trip colors
    * update forms to be consistent style (float labels)
    * go through and re-adjust the various page sizes for our different viewports
    * protocol documentation
    * wifi improvements:
        * wifi connection fail should default to AP mode
        * wifi should reconnect on failure
