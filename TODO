# v2.0.0 Release

* UI Rewrite
    * brineomatic graphs
    * move brineomatic UI html to Brineomatic class
    * app.onOpenPage(page, callback);
    * app.addPage("page", "content", openCallback);
    * stepper channels
    * dio channels
    * fan channels?
    * dont return new config on backend somehow refresh the ui with our newly stored config.
    * dark mode switcher doesnt seem to be working
    * remove all onclick calls from the html.
* settings page is ugly af.
    * borders for each config area like channels
    * side bar that loads each config page?
    * combine network and app config
        * move hostname from network to app
        * rename network to wifi
    * mqtt group
    * http server group
    * wifi group
    * users group
* sporadic crash when fading and saving to prefs at the same time.
* PsychicHttp release as well
* test/update/fix the release script for ota
* signalk plugins
    * should we move this to the firmware instead?
    * frothfet plugin - use key for paths instead of id
    * signalk sendit plugin - use key for paths instead of id
    * brineomatic plugin

# BRINEOMATIC

* update code for new Rev B board:
    * what new stuff can we do with brine_flowmeter and brine_salinity?
        * verify the main pump is working based on brine flow
        * verify the diverter valve is working based on brine vs product flow
        * add total_flow variable and verify it during runtime in addition to product flow
        * use brine_salinity to flush until seawater is gone
    * add stepper motor support
        * pid control output becomes stepper motor angle set point.
        * might allow us to use the PID tuning code
        * need to redesign high pressure valve attachment
    * add support for the piezo on error or success.
        * need to add various piezo sounds we can play
* add mid-level commands to set_watermaker
    * boost_pump
    * high_pressure_pump
    * flush_valve
    * fan
    * diverter valve
* add mid level UI icons/commands for watermaker parts:
    * boost_pump
    * hp pump
    * diverter valve
    * flush valve
    * fan
    * membrane_pressure_target
    * advanced manual mode to set servos, stepper, etc.
* add configuration options for:
    * flowmeters - ppl
    * tds (can we autodetect - whats this look like?)
    * diverter valve
    * hp valve servo
    * hp valve relay
    * diverter valve relay
    * default intervals for flush, etc.
    * options for display units
    * timeouts
    * high/low values
* move everything to SI units, add configurable units
* add tds calibration
* PID calibration?
* ntp server and next flush being an actual time that is stored in preferences (survive reboot)
* move brineomatic to interrupt based adc
* add simple HA support to brineomatic?
    * on/off switch to start/stop the watermaker
    * sensors for each output type...

# FROTHFET

* slow vs fast blow
    * fast checks getLatestReading()
    * slow checks getAverageReading()
* update forms to be consistent style (float labels)
* update yarrboard client if any changes needed - probably for state
* update signalk plugin - same
* go through and re-adjust the various page sizes for our different viewports
* protocol documentation
* add buzzer support - enable alarms for tripped or bypassed on a per-channel basis
* add OVERHEAT as a state - similar to trip, must be turned off before turn on.
    * if we have temperature, we should also check that before we enable the channel

# LONG TERM:

* global cleanup of strcpy, sprintf, etc.
* espwebtools?  https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/
* yarrboard c++ framework
    * create YarrboardApp class
    * move channel headers/classes to a channels/ folder
    * rename foo_channel to FooChannel to match class names
    * something something config
    * setLogo() or #define to set the logo file
    * create callbacks:
        * onSetup() - main.cpp
        * onLoop() - main.cpp
        * onInit() - prefs.cpp
        * onGenerateConfig() - prefs.cpp
        * onLoadConfig() - prefs.cpp
        * onMQTTUpdate() - mqtt.cpp
        * onHADiscovery() - mqtt.cpp
        * onUpdate() - protocol.cpp
        * onFastUpdate() - protocol.cpp
        * onStats() - protocol.cpp
        * onMessage() - gets called for every single message
        * registerNobodyCommand("command", callback);
        * registerGuestCommand("command", callback);
        * registerAdminCommand("command", callback);
    * for looping only stuff it would be best to do something like this:
        * yba.registerChannels(channels);
        * yba.registerMQTTChannels(channels);
        * yba.registerHAChannels(channels);
* yarrboard javascript framework
    * move most of the logic to a YarrboardUI class
    * generic event handlers:
        * onMessage()
        * onUpdate()
        * onConfig()
        * onPageOpen()
    * basechannel / extension classes
        * test and roll out the new class code
* other MFD integrations:
    * garmin?
    * raymarine?
* refactor yarrboard-firmware into something separate from frothfet / brineomatic / sendit:
    * what is the structure?
        * c++ code side: library with lots of callbacks?
        * javascript side: javascript include with lots of callbacks?
        * html???
